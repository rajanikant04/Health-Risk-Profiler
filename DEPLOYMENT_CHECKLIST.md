- [ ] ESLint checks passing (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] All tests passing (if applicable)
- [ ] No console errors in production build

### âœ… Performance
- [ ] Bundle size optimized (`npm run build:analyze`)
- [ ] Images compressed and optimized
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed
- [ ] Static assets cached properly
- [ ] Response times acceptable (<2s)

### âœ… Security
- [ ] No sensitive data in client code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] CORS configured correctly

### âœ… Functionality
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] OCR processing works
- [ ] Risk assessment calculates properly
- [ ] Recommendations generate correctly
- [ ] File upload functionality works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

### âœ… Monitoring
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding (`/api/health-check`)
- [ ] Metrics endpoint configured (`/api/metrics`)
- [ ] Error tracking ready (if using Sentry)
- [ ] Logging configured for production

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Final Build Test
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run optimize

# Test production build locally
npm run build:production
npm run start:production

# Verify health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health-check
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Domain/subdomain decided
- [ ] SSL certificate ready (auto with Vercel)
- [ ] CDN configuration (auto with Vercel)

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Option 1: Deploy via Git (Recommended)
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
git push origin main
# Then import on Vercel dashboard

# Option 2: Deploy via CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Production URL accessible
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] OCR functionality works
- [ ] Health check returns 200
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile version works
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Production Monitoring

### Health Check URLs
- Main health check: `https://your-domain.com/api/health-check`
- Metrics endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/metrics`

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Response time (target: <2s)
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- Memory usage (target: <400MB)
- OCR success rate (target: >90%)
- API availability (target: 99.9%)

### Alerts to Set Up
- [ ] Health check failure
- [ ] High error rate (>5%)
- [ ] High response time (>5s)
- [ ] Memory usage critical (>80%)
- [ ] Domain SSL expiry (if custom)

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Arise
1. **Check health endpoint**: Identify specific failures
2. **Review logs**: Check Vercel function logs
3. **Quick fixes**: Environment variables, DNS
4. **Rollback**: Revert to previous deployment
5. **Investigate**: Fix issues in development

### Emergency Contacts
- [ ] Vercel support: https://vercel.com/support
- [ ] Domain registrar support
- [ ] Team lead/project owner
- [ ] Technical documentation: `/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Success Criteria âœ¨

### Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Application loads in <3 seconds
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] Health check returns "healthy"
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Mobile experience is smooth
- [ ] OCR processing completes successfully
- [ ] Risk assessments generate properly
- [ ] Recommendations display correctly

## Next Steps After Deployment

### Immediate (First 24 hours)
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Check health endpoints regularly
- [ ] Review initial user feedback

### Short-term (First week)
- [ ] Analyze usage patterns
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan any quick fixes

### Long-term (Ongoing)
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Feature enhancements
- [ ] Scaling considerations
